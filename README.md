How to run the code
Open the vs code terminal by selecting the`terminal` from the top menu and press `new terminal`.
when the terminal shows up on screen then press run code.

The output should be the changes in the state acoording to the check on the code.
*At the increment the number goes up from '0' or '1' and becomes '2'. 
*At the decrement the number goes down form a '0' to a '1' or from a '2' to a '1'.
*At the reset the number becomes '0'

The approach
I first created the counter function,this stores the information about what should happen with the increment, decrement and reset state, a +1, -1 or a 0

Challenges
I find myself taking more time to complete the DJS shallenges that i did with the previous section, Even though we covered most of the concepts in JSL they are applied in a new way here so just when i though i knew how the concept was used it see it used differently
